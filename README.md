Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a client looking to provide resources and training courses for drivers to practice their driving exam. The goal is to help drivers prepare for and pass their driving exam. There should be different levels of packages and content for the users to purchase. DriverPass wants to provide in-person training, in the classroom and behind the wheel, with certified instructors. The system should be capable of managing these functions and providing admins with functions specific to their roles.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I had a good understanding of preparing the documents needed for the project. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the diagrams. Although I was confident in my ability to prepare the documents, I did not fully understand all of the diagrams we had to complete. I would definitely go back and work harder on them if I had the opportunity.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read through the documents that were provided or created throughout the project. These documents include the interview transcript, the use cases, requirements, etc. With these documents I was able to form visual overviews of what the system should do, the timeline of the project, and the specifics requested by DriverPass for the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I have to create a checklist of requirements. Sometimes I make notes to the side if I need to come back to that requirement later. I then map these items on a diagram and cross them off my checklist as I complete them.
